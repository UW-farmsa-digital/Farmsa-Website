# Project Information
### This is the repository for the FARM Student Association Official Website
The website is currently hosted at https://www.uwfarmsa.com using GitHub Pages

## Our Problem
The old deprecated website was built on wix and was hosted at https://waterloofarmsa.wixsite.com/mysite previously. This website was outdated, buggy and required a heavy uplift in both functionality and user interface. The new website created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js and Node was established due to the customizability that true code offered over the previous Wix website. The new website was built from the ground up to satisfy FARMSA's new requirements.
